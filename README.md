# dc-motor
This script analyzes the MPC PENTA 1L electric motor (as a motor for a 1-axis laser cutting machine), his step response and stability (with Bode diagrams, root locus and Nyquist diagram). Later, in SIMULINK, a closed-loop control system is designed (with feedforward and anti-windup), as well as an acceleration control, in order to minimize the time needed for the machine to operate.
